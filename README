N(ode)SoundSys

A simple sound system built in Node.js using the Express module.

The server can be interfaced through GET requests to play/stop/list sounds. The idea is similar to a jukebox.
Sounds can also be uploaded to the server through a POST endpoint.

GET API:
/list                - returns a table of available sounds.
/play?file=fn        - plays the file named 'fn'
/stop                - stops the currently playing sound
/deletesound?file=fn - deletes a file named 'fn'

POST API:
/soundupload         - uploads a sound to the server to make available for playing

Currently all sounds are played through mplayer.

Running NSoundSys:
Simply start the server: 'node app.js'
